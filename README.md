<b>Challonge Mobile</b>

This is a simple mobile app for Android used to manage a user's Challonge account and also view and create tournaments from their phone. The app uses HTTP Basic authentication to make calls to the Challonge API.

<b> Features to be Implemented </b>

-Dynamically drawn tournament brackets (will replace the current bracket viewing scheme, which simply opens bracket URLs through a WebView)
-Support for teams/organizations
-View tournaments without having to log in
-Give TO's the ability to send texts to players (similar to the SMSDash web app)
-Better screen rotation compatibility
-Lots of bug fixes
